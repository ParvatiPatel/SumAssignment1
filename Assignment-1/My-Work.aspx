                        It was my last semester project during diploma in Computer Science & Engineering.
                        It was a website where you can search and book online ticket for an event.Along with this there are several
                        features like you can see an upcomming event, you can reserve ticket for upcomming event,
                        It will allow to see remaning ticket and you can able to see your seat arrangement and location.

                    <p>
                       In this project,I use Ardunio Kit and programming to create a camera module
                        that can rotate in all direction either by using joy stick or when it sense 
                        some motion.This prject require both programming skill as well as good 
                        knowledge about Ardunio components.

                    <p>
                        Payment Gateway is anapplication that provide service that authorizes credit card payments for e-businesses,
                         online retailers, bricks and clicks,
                         A payment gateway facilitates the transfer of information between a payment portal (such as a website, mobile phone 
                        or interactive voice response service) and the Front End Processor or acquiring bank. It provide safe and secure way to transfer money.

                    <p>
                      It was web application that allows users to create survey of their own, by using one of the two designated templates. 
                      First one serves the purpose of creating a multiple choice question based survey where as the second template 
                      is meant for more closed ended questions based surveys.User is provided with a dashboard on successful generation of a survey, 
                      through which he can see how many no of people participated in survey, survey questions and contact details.
                      Survey creator must log in to create a survey. On completion of survey generation, link of the generated survey
                      will be sent to survey creators email accounts.
